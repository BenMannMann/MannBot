`$thoughts_folder` Here is the location to store MannBot's and users thoughts. Default is in the folder `MannBot/storage/thoughts`, which you will have to create
`$currency` The name you'd like to call the currency within the bot
`$bot_image` Image URL of the Bot
`$slot_icons` Icons to use for the slot machine. You can use normal or custom emojis for this by passing in '<:emojiname:emojiid>',
`$slot_winnings` How much the slot icons are worth 

2. Add the bot to your Discord server
This should generate the `users.json` file, which grabs all users within your server and assigns them defaults such as name, id, balance, xp and levels
